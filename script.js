//I've been going about this the wrong way, I thought it would be simple to use a text box, but clearly that was ass-backwards. I'm going to make buttons for numbers and functions, a section to display the vales to the user, and an equals button to print the result


(function () {
  'use strict'

    // array valueStore
  const valueStore = []
}())
