TODOS:

-DONE- prevent trailing operators from being pushed to 'history' (this should happen in input(), don't let 'equals' run if the last character is an operator)

-DONE- prevent entries which start with '*' and '/' from being pushed to history

- prevent placing two operators in a row (this should happen in input()) (almost working, there are edge cases involving previous and delete where it will still happen)

- prevent placing more than one decimal point in the same number (for this I'll have to keep track of each discrete number)

- prevent placing zeros at the beginning of a number, (if zero is pressed and currentNumber is empty just do nothing (GOD why didn't I think of that!? :-P) (this should happen in input)

- Update display() to clean history before displaying it
