TODOS:

Think about how to refactor decimalPlaced and currentOperator so that the code can be put in one place.

 - For currentOperator maybe check at the beginning of input() if the last character in current is an operator

 - Need to find a better way of handling decimals generally. A bug I have is that if 'equals' is pressed after 'decimalPlaced' is set to false, but then 'previous' is pressed, it is possible to place multiple decimals in the same number again

--------

Need to be able to clean leading zeros on *all* numbers before eval-ing, not just the first one.

 - Maybe I should make 'current' an array as well. When 'equal' is pressed, clean each index before adding it to a string and eval-ing the string, or just reduce the array to a number.

---------

IF equals is pressed and the last character is an operator, display an error message ("DOES NOT COMPUTE")

If equals is pressed and history is empty display an error, so that it won't display 'undefined'. (Yay! a regression)

Update display() to clean history before displaying it

Make it snazzy and sh*t

Make it keyboard-accessible

play a different note for each button when pressed
