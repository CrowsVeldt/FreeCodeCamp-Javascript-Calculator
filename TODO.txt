TODOS:

when pressed:

 - Number buttons add the number to the Argument1 if current operator is empty, to Argument2 otherwise.

 - The Decimal button adds a decimal to the current argument *unless* there is already one there, in which case it should do nothing

 - Operator buttons add the operator to the current operator

 - the clear buttons can stay the way they are: clear erases history and arguments, clear current just empties current Arguments

 - the equals button should combine Argument1+current operator+Argument2, push them to history as one entry, and display the total in Argument1. 

 - the backspace button should delete the previously entered character: last character of Argument2 until it is empty, then the operator, then the last character of Argument1 until it is empty



------------------------------

Prevent placing more than one operator in a row (if/else statement? or maybe just setting a flag) 

Make it snazzy and sh*t

Make it keyboard-accessible

play a different note for each button when pressed
