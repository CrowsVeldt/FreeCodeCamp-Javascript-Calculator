TODOS:

-DONE- Give all buttons the class 'button', add one eventListener to all buttons, and give them a second class, then select by that exactly what to do with them

-DONE- Add a 'clear' button to html, it should empty valueStore and wipe the displaySection

-DONE- Add other operator buttons, start with the basics (-, /, *), then think about more complicated ones

-DONE- Redo displaySection so that when the user presses '=' it still displays valueStore above the result 

-DONE- split valueStore into 'history' and 'current'

-DONE- when a number is pressed add it to 'current' and display current in 'total/current'

-DONE- when an operator or the equals butten is pressed add 'current' to 'history', empty 'current', and wipe 'total/current'

-DONE- when equals is pressed eval 'history' and display it in the 'total/current' display section

-DONE- add period button for decimals

-DONE- add 'ce' button, when 'ce' is pressed empty 'current' and wipe 'total/current'

-DONE- When an operator or the equals button is pressed: IF the first character of 'current' is '0' AND the second character is NOT '.' remove the first character before adding 'current' to 'history'

-DONE- IF 'history' is empty when 'equals' is pressed display something other than 'undefined'

Prevent placing more than one operator in a row (if/else statement? or maybe just setting a flag)

IF the last index of 'history' contains an operator when 'equals' is pressed, remove the operator before running eval 

*bug* if the last action was to enter a number, and the user presses another number, it simply tacks the new number on the end of the old number. This should instead wipe the history and start a new one. POSSIBLE FIX: IF the last button pressed was equals, and the next button pressed is a number, wipe the history. This would require keeping track of the last button pressed. No biggie.

Refactor so that the 'display' control is seperate from the 'input' control

Make it snazzy and sh*t
