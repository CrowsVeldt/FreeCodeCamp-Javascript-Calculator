TODOS:

 - the previous button should empty the current arguments, and pull the previous entry out of history.

 - the delete button should remove the previous character



------------------------------

*IMPORTANT* Think about how to refactor input() so that it is simpler

IF equals is pressed and the last character is an operator, display an error message ("DOES NOT COMPUTE")

Update display() to clean history before displaying it

Make it snazzy and sh*t

Make it keyboard-accessible

play a different note for each button when pressed

Add appropriately edifying comments

Research appropriate licence for this project and add it
